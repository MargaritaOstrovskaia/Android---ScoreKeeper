This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making an app that allows a user to keep track of points within a game.

The goal is to create an Score Keeper app which gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different teams playing a game of your choice. 

**My goal:** implemented the Darts game Scoring system.

### Evaluation rule details:
- The chosen game has either multiple amounts of points that can be scored, as in american football, or multiple important metrics to track, such as fouls, outs, and innings in baseball.
- App is divided into two columns, one for each team.
- Each column contains a large TextView to keep track of the current score for that team.
- Each column contains multiple buttons. The buttons must track either: Each track a different kind of scoring or Each track a different metric (one score, the other fouls, for instance).
- The layout contains a ‘reset’ button.
- The code runs without errors.
- Each score button updates the score TextView in its column by adding the correct number of points.
- The reset button resets the scores on both of the score TextViews.
- Any classes are named after the object they represent.All variables are named by their intended contents.
- All methods are named by their intended effect or in the style required by a callback interface.
